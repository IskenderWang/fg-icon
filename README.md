# fg-icon

FlightGear icon for macOS which improves on the original we had introduced (big up Michael Danilov for that) by better aligning with the app icon style guidelines. Of course, I used no design kits provided by Apple (as that would probably lead to licensing trouble) other than to get a sense of how it should look. Created entirely with the help of Inkscape, my CLI, and the guidelines, as listed below.
